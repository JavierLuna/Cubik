# Cubik
Neural network who solves rubik cubes

##Goal

Im learning machine learning and I bought myself a Rubik cube, so I thought It'd be a good idea to teach a neural network
to solve a Rubik Cube

##Roadmap
Here's how I plan to do it:

1. **Code a Rubik Cube (Done)**: Code a rubik cube and the basic movements it can do [link](https://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cubo_de_Rubik/Generalidades/Notaci%C3%B3n_Singmaster)
2. **Solve the Rubik Cube (WIP)**: Code a backtracking algorithm to solve the cube in the lesser number of movements possible.
The data produced will be feeded into the neural network to train it.
3. **AI solves the Rubik Cube**: Code a neural network and train it to solve the cube.
